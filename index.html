    <h1>EAT PRETZELS ONE DAY, CROISSANTS THE NEXT!</h1>

    <p>My pitch is to create a site which provides editorials and resources on study abroad opportunities. In my experience, many authors rosily describe studying abroad, while others happily heap on aspersions. Yes, the upfront expenses can get insane, but study in a foreign country confers great benefits. So how could one know wheter to take the plunge? An informed decision looks like a convoluted one. I'd like to help clear the mess.</p>

    <h2>But why?</h2>
    <p>Excellent befuddlement. Allow me to explain!</p>
    <p>In your Internet sojourns to discover <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=why+study+abroad&oq=why+study&aqs=chrome.3.69i57j69i65j0l4.4816j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8' target='_blank'>the purpose of studying abroad</a>, you will find various answers. Let me assemble the most cogent:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You may learn a foreign language. (<a href='https://www.duolingo.com/course/nl-NL/en/Learn-Dutch-Online' target='_blank'>Dutch</a> is an easy start for English-speakers.) Increasingly, the <a href='' target='_blank'><!--find freaking articles about these things-->cognitive</a>, <a href='' target='_blank'>economic</a>, and <a href='' target='_blank'>sociological</a> benefits of learning more than one's mother tongue are being revealed. Study abroad help this by providing immersion, which best facilitates language learning.</li><br/>

      <li>You realize that the locals don’t have much duty to accommodate you: you do. <em>Because being in Paris when you don't speak French teaches you humility</em>. Studying abroad is not so much learning of cultures as it is understanding better how you must cooperate with others. Haughtiness evaporates when you need to get directions, or buy breakfast, or talk to a bookstore clerk. <strong>All in a foreign language</strong>.</li><br/>

      <li>You understand the wealth of opportunities available to you. Take for instance research grants and fellowships. Many domestic ones encourage international research by granting more money for flights and accommodations. Fellowships like the <a href='' target='_blank'>German DAAD</a> also permit longer stays in a foreign land. And don’t forget teaching and professional fellowships! Countless programs want native-English speakers to teach <a href='' target='_blank'><!--that one program in austria-->English throughout Europe</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So, with these points in mind, I invite you to think more deeply about studying abroad. Look through some of the opportunities below.</p>

    <h3>How about Everywhere?</h3>
    <li><a href='https://www.ciee.org' target='_blank'>CIEE</a> is a flipping incredible organization that sponsors a ton of international opportunities. They offer high-quality yet affordable programs. And even better--<em>they have <strong>scholarships!!!</strong></em></li>

    <h3>How about Germany?</h3>
    <li> <a href='https://www.studyabroad.com/in-germany/munich' target='_blank'>For example, Munich</a>. The universities, pretzels and beer are to die for.</li><br/>
    <li>Or something more appealing, like <a href='http://www.augsburg.edu/academics/augsburg-experience/study-abroad/' target='_blank'>Augsburg</a>. P.S. It isn't as obnoxious a city.</li>

    <h3>How about the Netherlands?</h3>
    <li><a href='' target='_blank'>Amsterdam</a> is a gorgeous metropolis with art, commerce, and learning all in one place.</li><br/>
    <li>And don’t forget <a href='' target='_blank'>Rotterdam!</a> (No-erase-Erasmus.)</li>

    <h3>How about Hungary?</h3>
    <li><a href='' target='_blank'>Budapest</a> and its Hungarian language provide a challenge, but one well-worth it. (Also…look at the river…)</li><br/>

    <h3>And, of course...how about France?</h3>
    <li>Paris is great, but what about <a href='' target='_blank'>Aix</a>? Nobody in their right mind would forsake a city (almost) on the sea.</li><br/>
    <li>Schools in Brittany offer a different definition of France. Check out <a href='' target='_blank'>Rennes</a>.</li>
