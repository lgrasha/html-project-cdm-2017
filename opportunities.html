     <h3>How about Everywhere?</h3>
          <p><a href='https://www.ciee.org' target='_blank'>CIEE</a> is a flipping incredible organization that sponsors a ton of international opportunities. They offer high-quality yet affordable programs. And even better--<em>they have <strong>scholarships!!!</strong></em></p>

     <h3>How about Germany?</h3>
          <p><a href='https://www.studyabroad.com/in-germany/munich' target='_blank'>For example, Munich</a>. The universities, pretzels and beer are to die for. Or something more appealing, like <a href='http://www.augsburg.edu/academics/augsburg-experience/study-abroad/' target='_blank'>Augsburg</a>. P.S. It isn't as obnoxious a city.</p>

     <h3>How about the Netherlands?</h3>
          <p><a href='https://www.iesabroad.org/programs/amsterdam-social-sciences-humanities-study-amsterdam' target='_blank'>Amsterdam</a> is a gorgeous metropolis with art, commerce, and learning all in one place.</p>

     <h3>How about Hungary?</h3>
          <p class='hungary'><a href='https://welovebudapest.com/en/2015/02/19/9-reasons-to-study-abroad-in-budapest/' target='_blank'>Budapest</a> and its Hungarian language provide a challenge, but one well-worth it. (Also…look at the river…)

     <h3>And, of course...how about France?</h3>
          <p>Paris is great, but what about <a href='http://www.ceastudyabroad.com/explore/discover-the-city/aix-en-provence#go-with-cea' target='_blank'>Aix</a>? Nobody in their right mind would forsake a city (almost) on the sea. Schools in Brittany offer a different definition of France. Check out <a href='http://www.sya.org/schools/sya-france' target='_blank'>Rennes</a>.</p>
